                Mobile apps have increasingly become the preferred method of banking, as clients are able to access
                their accounts and conduct transactions at their convenience, anytime and anywhere. Due to the
                widening scope and adoption of mobile banking, the usability of such interfaces becomes
                increasingly important as a focus of study and directly impacts the user experience of clients
                across all demographics.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the opportunity to test the latest Credit Suisse iOS mobile banking
                app prototype, we focus on usability of the user interface and the payments workflow. We seek
                to uncover possible usability issues and discover new ways to improve payments on the mobile
                platform from an international point of view.

        <div class="fl-ns w-100 w-50-ns pl3-m pl3-l">
            <p>
                For the study, we tested the prototype with thirteen
                participants spanning relationship managers and multinational university students. Our findings
                suggest that simplicity, efficiency, and contextual convenience are of the highest priority when
                designing banking experiences on the mobile platform.
            </p>
            <p>
                We conclude with recommendations for the
                final design of the interface and underscore the importance of aligning the feature set to the
                purpose of mobile banking, error prevention, and educating the users on new design and
                functionality.

                An entire subfield within Human-Computer Interaction focuses on testing the usability of interfaces
                in hopes to develop them into systems that are as user-friendly as possible. The main goal for
                usability testing is to “improve the quality of an interface by finding flaws in it” of which
                “cause problems for users” (Lazar 2010). In contrast to Summative Testing which takes place at the
                later stages of the design process, formative user-based testing is a subfield of usability that
                occurs in the earlier-stage design process. At this stage, users are often given wireframes and
                prototypes to test that don’t yet have the entire set of features implemented. As a result, the
                main focus of formative usability studies is to provide an opportunity for problem discovery,
                generate data, and gather feedback that can be helpful in guiding the direction of the final design
                of the interface.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through the process of usability testing, it is said that five users will find around 80% of the
                usability problems in a given interface (Virzi, 1992). However, that “magic number” also depends on
                other factors, such as the complexity of the interface and the scope of the tasks (Lazar 2010).
                Regardless, the goal of usability testing is not to find all the usability issues, but instead to
                uncover the major, high-priority, high-severity ones.
            </p>
            <p>
                The basis of usability testing is centered around various task scenarios that emulate real-world
                ones. In doing so, both quantitative and qualitative data are generated throughout the process.
                Different quantitative metrics such as task success, satisfaction, and error rates, can be
                evaluated throughout the interviews, while qualitative data can be identified as users talk through
                their thought process aloud. This is also known as the Thinking-Aloud Protocol (Lazar 2010). This
                protocol is particularly helpful for Formative usability testing given that not every part of the
                interface is interactable or implemented.
            </p>


        </div>
        <div class="fl-ns w-100 w-50-ns pl3-m pl3-l">
            <p>
                Another critical part of usability testing includes surveys and questionnaires. Questions that
                probe users’ perception about a system may encompass: simple rating scales to rate difficulty and
                quantify expectations before and after a given task or scenario, such as Likert scales; specific
                qualitative attributes, such as visual appeal and enjoyment, on users’ emotional connection with
                the system; and open-ended questions to encourage critical thinking, such as ranking top three
                things users liked the most (Tullis, 2008).
            </p>
            <p>
                In particular, the System Usability Scale (SUS) provides a standardized metric for benchmarking and
                evaluating the overall usability of a given system (Brooke 1996). The survey consists of ten
                questions -- five of which are positively worded, while the other half are negatively worded. All
                the questions are taken into account and combined to form an overall score from 0 to 100, with 100
                being the best score. Scores above 80 are considered good; consequently, all systems should aim to
                surpass this threshold (Tullis 2008).
